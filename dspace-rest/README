A RESTful web services API for DSpace, built using JAX-RS1 JERSEY.

Getting Started
mvn clean package
#If you run into an issue with Maven, try manually importing the Jar/War.
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.dspace -DartifactId=dspace-rest -Dversion=4.0-SNAPSHOT -Dclassifier=classes -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=dspace-rest/target/dspace-rest.war
mvn clean package
ant update


Configure tomcat to know about the rest webapp.
 <Context path="/rest"  docBase="/dspace/webapps/rest"  allowLinking="true"/>

At this point, this is a READ ONLY API for DSpace, for the anonymous user. Only Anonymous READ Communities, Collections, Items, and Bitstreams are available.

Endpoints:
View the list of top-level communities
- http://localhost:8080/rest/communities

View a specific community
-- http://localhost:8080/rest/communities/:ID

View a specific community, list its subcommunities, and subcollections
-- http://localhost:8080/rest/communities/:ID?expand=all

View the list of collections
- http://localhost:8080/rest/collections

View a specific collection
-- http://localhost:8080/rest/collections/:ID

View an Item, and see its bitstreams
- http://localhost:8080/rest/items/:ID

View information about a bitstream
- http://localhost:8080/rest/bitstreams/:ID

There is an ?expand= query parameter for more expensive operations. You can tack it on the end of endpoints.
It is optional, all, some or none. The response will usually indicate what the available "expand" options are.
